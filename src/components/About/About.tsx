            <p>
                I´m graduated JavaScript developer from Stockholm.
                With me you get more than someone who can write functional code. I am a problem solver who thrives when I am met with new tasks. I'm a quick learner and teamplayer.
                I am an active, curious person. I always put the team’s needs first and believe that I can see the bigger picture when it comes to the process of developing a product.
            </p>
